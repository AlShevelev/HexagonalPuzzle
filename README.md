# Six-Sided Puzzle - Cities
"Six-Sided Puzzle - Cities" is my the very first (and, I hope, the very last) Flutter project. 
It's a puzzle game - quite simple but exciting. The rules are plain - you have a picture, divided into hexagons and you need to assemble it (each hexagon can be tapped or moved).

I've included several screenshots below so you can get an idea of the gameplay.
